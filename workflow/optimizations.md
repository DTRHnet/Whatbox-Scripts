# Optimizations Workflow

## Performance Optimization

### Code Level
- Profile before optimizing
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize algorithms
- Reduce complexity

### Resource Level
- Minimize memory usage
- Optimize database queries
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use async operations where possible

### Monitoring
- Track execution time
- Monitor resource usage
- Log performance metrics
- Set up alerts for degradation

## Optimization Principles
1. Measure first, optimize second
2. Optimize for readability when performance is adequate
3. Document optimization decisions
4. Re-test after optimizations
